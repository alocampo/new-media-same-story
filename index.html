    <h2>Don’t scoff — the world’s top scientists are quite serious. In the U.S. scientists are probing a theory that pollution of the atmosphere is making the earth warmer.</h2>
    <h3>New cities spring up, factories are built, smoke and smog belch everywhere, Jet planes and rockets shoot out exhaust fumes—and year by year the pollution gets worse. Some scientists suspect that increased carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere are acting as a “greenhouse,” thus stopping the earth from losing some of its heat to outer space.</h3>
    <h3>The U.S. Government has taken this theory so seriously that its weather experts are taking samples of upper air in the Antarctic and other remote regions to check on it. The project is among many which nations have undertaken in the 1957-58 Geophysical Year to find out how—and why—the earth is setting warmer.</h3>
    <h3>Two weather experts in Australia, Prof. J. MacDonald Holmes and Dr. E. B. Kraus, this week told me about the project. They mentioned lots of other theories, too—the earth changing its solar alignment, increased sunspot activity, bigger falls of meteorites into the earth’s atmosphere, and even that more recent bogey, nuclear weapon tests. Scotsman Holmes, Professor of Geography at Sydney University, and Czech-born Dr. Kraus, a top–flight weatherman now working for the Snowy Hydro Authority at Cooma, have more than a passing interest in Sydney’s recent weird weather.</h3>
    <h3>With colleagues all over the world — geographers, geologists, meteorologists, and physicists—they are studying a bewildering pattern of melting glaciers, rising tides and unpredictable climates. The research involved has to cover many thousands of years, great gaps in records man has kept, and many, many unexplained factors.</h3>
    <h3>But somehow, somewhere, Sydney’s current spell of Indian summer fits Into the climatic puzzle. Today we are still living near the end of the last of the four Ice Ages because the retreat of ice from Europe didn’t begin until 25,000 years ago. None of these four Ice Ages ever completely covered the earth, though they considerably changed the face of Australia—and its climate.</h3>
    <h3>But just how, and in what cycles, we don’t know because, unlike Europe, there were no civilised men here to keep records, Sydney Weather Bureau records go back only to 1859, and no one there has bothered to keep a comparative check on likely climatic cycles.</h3>
    <h3>About 10,000 years ago —which is as far back as Professor Holmes and his associates are trying to check Australia’s climatic variations — the continent was a</h3>

    <h3> colder and wetter place than it is today. Mount Kosciusko had a perennial ice-cap of at least 3000 feet, says Professor Holmes, though nowadays its annual winter snow may not exceed three or four good falls. Australia’s sea-level at that time was about 73ft, lower than at present, fore the melting ice regions sent it higher.</h3>
    <h3>Professor Holmes says there is very definite evidence that in the past 30-35 years, glaciers in Central Europe, North America, New Zealand, Greenland, and New Guinea have been retreating. Part evidence of this are greater deposits of moraine — rock and dirt retreating glaciers leave behind. Scientists are now eagerly awaiting data from the recent Fuchs-Hillary expeditions to the Antarctic, which are expected to show that the massive polar ice-caps there are melting.</h3>
    <h2>Professor Holmes:</h2>
    <h3>“All over the world there are other signs of increasing warmth, with colored butterflies their ‘melanism’ —pigmentation — is becoming darker, a sure sign of increased heat. In northern Norway for trees are dying out and giving way to spruce, a warmer weather species. Over the top of Europe the pack-ice is retreating, and the Arctic Ocean there is becoming more navigable. With a little man-made help from ice-breakers the Russians hope soon to have a clear waterway from the Barents Sea right round to the Bering Sea, north of the Pacific."</h3>
    <h3>Recent changes in the world’s “heat equator” also bear out the “warmer world" theory, says Professor Holmes. This “heat equator” is a flexible line which traces the highest mean temperatures right round the earth annually. In northern latitudes the “heat equator” pinpoints “hot spots” over the oceans; south of the Equator it zigzags over the land masses. And in recent years the “heat equator” has been shifting more and more to the south, including Australia.</h3>
    <h3>And what about Australia? Professor Holmes says that up to recent years it was generally accepted that the continent’s weather moved in 35-year cycles. Some experts have since traced it to 11-year cycles, and now there is a theory that the climate here may be governed by five-year cycles. For example, this winter appears to </h3>

        <h3>What happens when the world’s average mean temperature rises a degree?</h3>
        <h3>Because the transition is slow — over at least a century, possibly 300-400 years — humans and animals suffer no physical ill effects. But nature changes; warm weather crops can be grown in regions where previously they would have perished. Insects, too, invade new areas; sometimes with detrimental effects, like the tsetse fly in Africa, which has been found in areas where it wasn’t a century ago.</h3>
        <h3>What about the danger from rising tides? Neither our generation nor the next should have to worry, say Prof. Holmes and Dr. Kraus.</h3>
        <h3>Sydney’s present high tides appear to be caused by a general southward movement of tropical waters, which is running late this year. They’re no higher than at Christmas — their normal “highest.” For the world’s tidal level to rise 5ft, its average temperature would have to rise 2.8 degrees.</h3>

        <h1>Failure to Slow Warming Will Set Off Climate ‘Tipping Points,’ Scientists Say</h1>

        </div>
        <h2>Failure to limit global warming to the targets set by international accords will most likely set off several climate “tipping points,”</h2>
        <h3>a team of scientists said on Thursday, with irreversible effects including the collapse of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, abrupt thawing of Arctic permafrost and the death of coral reefs.</h3>
        <h3>The researchers said that even at the current level of warming, about 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels, some of these self-sustaining changes might have already begun. But if warming reached above 1.5 degrees Celsius, the more ambitious of two targets set by the 2015 Paris Agreement, the changes would become much more certain.</h3>
        <h3>And at the higher Paris target, 2 degrees Celsius, even more tipping points would likely be set off, including the loss of mountain glaciers and the collapse of a system of deep mixing of water in the North Atlantic.</h3>
        <h3>The changes would have significant, long-term effects on life on Earth.</h3>
        <h3>The collapse of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, for example, would lead to unrelenting sea level rise, measured in feet, not inches, over centuries. The thawing of permafrost would release more heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, hindering efforts to limit warming. A shutdown of ocean mixing in the North Atlantic could affect global temperatures and bring more extreme weather to Europe.</h3>
        <h3>Johan Rockström, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and one of the researchers, said the team had “come to the very dire conclusion that 1.5 degrees Celsius is a threshold” beyond which some of these effects would start. That makes it all the more imperative, he and others said, for nations to quickly and drastically cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases to curb global warming.</h3>
        <h3>The research is in line with recent assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of experts convened by the United Nations, that beyond 1.5 degrees of warming, the threats of climate change grow considerably.</h3>

            <h2>“It really provides strong scientific support for rapid emission cuts in line with the Paris Agreement,”</h2>
            <h3>said David Armstrong McKay, a climate scientist at the University of Exeter in Britain and the lead author of a paper describing the researchers’ work, published in Science. Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees “doesn’t guarantee we don’t see tipping points,” Dr. McKay said. “But it reduces the likelihood.”</h3>
            <h3>Countries have not pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions enough to meet either Paris target, although the climate and energy legislation passed by Congress last month moves the United States much closer to its own goals. Current policies put the world on pace for nearly 3 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century. At that level of warming, even more tipping points would be set off, the researchers said.</h3>
            <h3>The concept of climate tipping points has been around for decades. But it has also been accompanied by a high degree of uncertainty and debate, including about the threshold temperatures beyond which some changes would begin, and whether some of these events even meet the definition of changes that would be self-sustaining no matter what happens with future warming.</h3>
            <h3>A major study in 2008 identified more than a dozen parts of Earth’s system that could reach a tipping point. The new research eliminated a few and added several more, identifying a total of 16 parts, including nine that</h3>

        <h3>But the main goal of the new research, which reviewed studies that had used data from past climates, current observations and computer simulations, was to reduce the uncertainty about when the tipping points might be reached.</h3>
        <h3>The study “puts temperature thresholds on all the tipping elements,” Dr. Rockström said. “That has never been done before."</h3>
        <h3>Bill Hare, who is the chief executive of Climate Analytics, a nonprofit research and policy organization, and who was not involved in the study, said, “It systematically puts together and synthesizes the state of scientific knowledge about critical Earth system tipping points.”</h3>
        <h3>“It reinforces the urgency of the global community working together to halve emissions by 2030 and get to net zero by 2050,” he said.</h3>
        <h3>Thomas Stocker, a climate scientist at the University of Bern in Switzerland who was not involved in the study, cautioned that much more research was needed on the subject of tipping points. “It’s not the ultimate word,” he said of the study’s findings. “It’s a contribution to an important conversation that is ongoing.”</h3>
        <h3>What is needed, Dr. Stocker said, is a comprehensive analysis by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, perhaps as part of the next round of assessments, which is due in the second half of this decade.</h3>
